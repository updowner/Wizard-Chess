# Wizard-Chess
inspired by harry potter 
I like playing chess game and up to now I played a lot on the Internet or with different Apps. But I was frustrated to pass all this time behind a screen.

I started to look into the electronic chess games, but I rapidly realize that the best choice was to do it by myself. I took time to learn about AI, game engine, chess pieces detection to finally design my own chess game.
So, this  describes an automated chessboard.
The automated chess board is composed of an XY table with an electromagnet on the moving trolley. The chessboard is placed above the XY table and the chess pieces are equipped with magnets. When the electromagnet is below the chess piece a magnetic contact can be generated through the chessboard, so that the chess piece follows the trolley when it moves.
